### Usage

Simply install the extension and navigate to the [SmartView creation page](https://campus.fsu.edu/webapps/gradebook/do/instructor/addModifyCustomViews) for your specific recitation section.

Then, open the extension by clicking the icon (it's the FSU logo), and enter in your students' names in the following format:

```
Smith,John
Doe,John
Bohr,Niels
Newton,Isaac
Washington,George
Planck,Max
Ritchie,Dennis
Stroustrup,Bjarne
```

If you weren't able to discern the format, it's:

```
lastname,firstname
lastname,firstname
lastname,firstname
lastname,firstname
lastname,firstname
lastname,firstname
```

Then, simply click "Select Students", and the students for your recitation section should now be selected in the select form.
